## Dashboard CSS Challenge

- **Deployment:**
  - The finalized dashboard is live and accessible at [this URL](https://malikkotb.github.io/dashboard/), offering a platform to view and interact with the completed project.

For this exciting dashboard challenge, I tackled it using HTML and CSS, meeting these specific requirements:

- **Tech Stack:**
  - **HTML and CSS**: The challenge necessitated the use of HTML and CSS, and I embraced this requirement to craft the dashboard.
  - **Tailwind CSS**: To streamline styling, I opted for Tailwind CSS, enhancing efficiency and design aesthetics.
  
- **Layout Evolution:**
  - I kicked off by creating the **sidebar**, setting the stage for navigation and menu options.
  - Then, I tackled the **top sticky navbar**, making sure essential features are easily accessible as users scroll.
  - Afterward, I focused on the **main content**, carefully arranging elements like cards to optimize user experience.

- **Responsive Design & Layout:**
  - To ensure a seamless user experience, I implemented a **grid system**. It featured 3 columns for larger screens and elegantly transitioned to a single column for smaller screens.
  - The design had to be **responsive** from mobiles to desktops.
  - The **sidebar behavior** was adjusted to disappear on smaller screens and reposition at the bottom for mobile viewing.

- **Design:**
  - I referred to the provided [Figma design file](https://www.figma.com/proto/p0DenCZpXVWBwL2ESQ4TVR/Challenge?type=design&node-id=1-2&t=uIqLbaCMsTCndc5P-1&scaling=contain&page-id=0%3A1) for design details.

- **Compatibility:**
  - The implementation was tested for compatibility on the latest versions of **Chrome**, **Firefox**, and **Safari** browsers.
